# Portfolio Project

This project is a single page static site.

The main purpose is to have a place where others can see my skill set, see the projects I've done and find out what I'm about.


## Launch  

You can visit the site at www.andrewcooke.dev
Alternatively you can clone this repo and open the index.html in your browser.
